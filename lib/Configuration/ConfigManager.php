     * $configFiles = [
     *     __DIR__ . '/yapealDefaults.yaml',

     * ];
     * $manager->create($configFiles);
     * ...
     * </code>
     *
     * An example that includes optional priority and watched flags:
     * <code>>
     * <?php
     * ...
     * $manager = new ConfigManager($dic);
     * $configFiles = [
     *     ['pathName' => __DIR__ . '/yapealDefaults.yaml', 'priority' => PHP_INT_MAX, 'watched' => false],

     * ];
     * $manager->create($configFiles);
     * ...

     * addConfigFile() if not given.
