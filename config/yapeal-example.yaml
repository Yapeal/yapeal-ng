Yapeal:
# NOTE: All of the settings that MUST BE changed for production or testing when
# Yapeal-ng is installed in vendor/ are not commented out to make it easier to
# find them once you, as an application developer, copy it to your
# application's config/ directory. See ConfiguringYapeal.md and InstallingYapeal.md for more info.

    Cache:
    # DEPRECATED (see new FileSystem settings) these settings are no longer used and will be removing in future.
    # Settings in the 'Cache' section normally will only be changed during troubleshooting or development work.
        # DEPRECATED (see new FileSystem settings) this setting is no longer used and will be removing in the future.
        # Base directory where the cached XML will be stored if filesystem
        # caching is active.
        # The default setting of '{Yapeal.baseDir}cache/' uses a cache/ directory inside the directory where Yapeal was
        # installed.
        #dir: '{Yapeal.baseDir}cache/'
        # DEPRECATED (see new FileSystem settings) this setting is no longer used and will be removing in the future.
        # Used to set the file system caching mode to be used. Currently the only modes are 'all' and 'none' but
        # additional modes may be added in the future. If you want the to continue to have the cache files change
        # the setting to 'all'.
        # The default of 'none' turns off using the filesystem cache.
        #fileSystemMode: none

    Error:
    # DEPRECATED (merged with Log settings) these settings are no longer used and will be removing in future.

            # and this will probably need to be changed.

            # The following two settings replace the now deprecated Yapeal.Cache.fileSystemMode setting which was
            # handled static when the configuration files were read at startup. With new settings and some code changes
            # the possiblity of turning caching on or off during execution becomes possible.

            # Used to enable writing of XML cache files for Eve APIs. Yapeal-ng does not require filesystem caching to

        # Directory where log file will be stored.

        # Threshold that should trigger logging. A lower number increase the
        # amount of logging you will see.
        # Allowed values:
        # 100(DEBUG), 200(INFO), 250(NOTICE), 300(WARNING), 400(ERROR),
        # 500(CRITICAL), 550(ALERT), 600(EMERGENCY)

        # -v, -vv, and -vvv verbosity levels can be used to override this
        # setting at runtime.
        # -q maps to 400(ERROR), and the -v options are mapped from 250(NOTICE)
        # to 100(DEBUG) with each step causing increased logging.
        # When neither of the options are given 'yc' commands use a default
        # threshold of 300(WARNING).

        # Commonly this is used to include short contact information like an e-mail. Remember this information is
        # visible to anyone in the headers.
